# inpro (Initiate-Project)
Inpro is a fairly simple script that creates the necessary files for a new project based on the input language and provided directory.

As an example: `inpro new python Discord-Bot`
Inpro will parse through the provided arguments, and will then create new directories and necessary project files, such as `main.py`, while also initiating a virtual environment for applicable languages.
